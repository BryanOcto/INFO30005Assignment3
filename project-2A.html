        <h3>Problem and context</h3>
        <p>The cost of living crisis has made it increasingly difficult for university students to acquire resources to explore new practical hobbies and connect with others of similar interests.</p>
        <p>Many practical hobbies often require expensive equipment to do, such as sewing requiring sewing machines and photography requiring DSLR cameras. With the cost of living crisis, it becomes difficult for university students to purchase such equipment to explore new practical hobbies. Furthermore, it is difficult to gauge whether one would like a hobby or not before trying it, thus making the high cost difficult to justify. This results in university students not trying new practical hobbies, which not only can impact their wellbeing but also reduce opportunities to connect with like-minded people, as hobbies are often a medium to bond with others.</p>
        <p>Thus the first part of this assignment explores how a Library of Things (LoT) could reduce the costs of exploring and starting new practical hobbies by allowing students to <em>borrow</em> such items (for free) instead of purchasing them. This way, students can explore many practical hobbies to find the one they like, and thus bond with others who have similar hobbies, which can improve their wellbeing.</p>
        <blockquote>The Library of Things allows students to explore practical hobbies by enabling them to borrow expensive necessary equipment.</blockquote>

        <h3>Roles and contributions</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The team consisted of the following members:
                <ul>
                    <li>Bryan Susanto (Experience designer, Feedback) <-- this is me!</li>
                    <li>Nicholas Kurniasurja (Experience designer, Storyboards and desktop prototypes)</li>
                    <li>Jake De Andrade (Experience designer, Problem and accessibility statements)</li>
                    <li>Jesslyn Andriono (Experience designer, Service Journey map and problem statement)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Timeline: March - April 2025 (about 1 month)</li>
            <li>Platform: Focuses on the overall service including digital and in-person elements. Emphasis on the in-person elements.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Most of the design process was done collaboratively, however one particular aspect where I was the majority contributor was in collecting and synthesizing feedback, in particular using feedback grids to do that in the report. Although we ourselves are students and thus part of the target audience, we are likely to overlook several needs and impose our own biases from our preferences, and overlook potential consequences of our ideas. Thus it is important to collect and consolidate feedback so we can act upon it.</p>

        <h3>Design principles</h3>
        <p>The following design principles guided the design of this library of things service:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Responsive to feedback</b>: We are designing this for university students more generally, not (just) us. Therefore we should listen attentively to the needs and preferences of our target audience, and design the service according to them.</li>
            <li><b>Accessible</b>: Ensures the library of things service is accessible to all, including those with disability, so that the benefits of allowing university students to explore hobbies can be enjoyed by all.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Key steps, decisions, and pivots</h3>
        <p>This section outlines the main stages and pivots our team took throughout the project as we iterate based on feedback. This only includes parts that I contributed to; for other steps please refer to the portfolios of other team members listed previously.</p>

        <h4>Background research</h4>
        <p>Before attempting to solve this problem ourselves using a library of things (we are constrained to using a library of things to solve the issue by our assigned prompt), we first did research on how people have practically implemented it and how they used it to solve their problems for inspiration. For example, we found that one organization used self-service lockers to implement the library of things, reducing space and staff requirements, making it more environmentally friendly. Lockers became a key part of the library of things we designed within a hypothetical space given on campus.</p>

        <h4>Divergent thinking: 10+10 sketches</h4>
        <p>After finding inspiration, we brainstormed various ideas on how we could use the library of things to solve the defined problem before. We employed divergent thinking as exploring the most number of ideas possible is a good way to find the best idea. We did this through using 10+10 sketches, where each of us sketched 10 ideas in the first round, then sketched 10 variations of the best ideas from the first round. After this is done, the best ideas are chosen and presented for feedback.</p>
        <figure class="small">

        <p>This is when the first pivot of the project occurred from feedback, namely abandoning the RFID tag ideas, addressing concerns of privacy, and digitizing the hobby master. There were other points but they are too lengthy to be covered here, and these are the main ones; refer to the feedback grid I compiled below for an overview of them.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>An alternative to the locker idea was to use RFID tags on items combined with open shelves and the library guarded by a turnstile. Students would use their student ID to scan items and to enter and leave the library. However, RFID tags was considered problematic as the stickers can fall off borrowed items, and replacements are not only inconvenient but also costly. The university restricting the use of student IDs due to privacy concerns also makes it difficult for us to use it for the purposes of keeping track of a student's borrowed items.</li>
            <li>The match-making algorithm to help students find others of similar interests also wasn't received well due to privacy concerns. Thus it is now an opt-in only feature instead of being on by default.</li>
            <li>The “hobby master” who's role was to help students find items for hobbies and to help them with how to use such items was made digital instead of being made a person on-site. Others preferred the convenience of such help being accessible anywhere and at any time.</li>
        </ol>

        <figure>
            <img src="./images/10-plus-10-sketches--feedback.jpg" alt="Eight of the best ideas we had, namely: 1. RFID scanning, 2. articles on hobbies, 3. organizing items by hobbies on shelves, 4. in-app suggestions for hobbies you might like, 5. turnstiles, 6. user-matching algorithms for others with similar hobbies, 7. borrower trust score, and 8. disabling student ID to incentivise students to return item.">
            <figcaption>The chosen best sketches which we received feedback on. There were two additional chosen sketches namely the use of lockers and the “hobby master” not shown here.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>Thus this feedback showed how we overlooked the weaknesses of several ideas, and the concerns and preferences of our target audience, namely privacy and the convenience of accessing help anytime and anywhere.</p>

        <h4>Storyboards</h4>
        <p>With this feedback, we drafted out what the service could look like when the library of things was implemented with lockers and a online booking system.</p>

        <figure>
            <img src="./images/storyboard-v1.jpg" alt="Sticky notes on a table showing the steps involved in borrowing an item from the library of things through the online booking system.">
            <figcaption>First storyboard draft of the library of things experience using a locker system.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>After presenting this for feedback, we again realised some things we have overlooked. I compiled this in another feedback grid. A refined draft of the storyboard was made later based on this feedback by Nicholas.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Some lockers may be inaccessible to some people, e.g. due to it being too high for those on a wheelchair. One idea that came out of the feedback sessions to solve this was to have dedicated accessible lockers at a low level, which staff will placed booked items in if requested in the online booking.</li>
            <li>More feedback in the form of live updates in the mobile app can make the experience more accessible as it lets the user know what is going on in the service at all times.</li>
            <li>A log of item damages and previous borrowers to increase accountability for handling borrowed items with care.</li>
        </ol>

        <h4>Desktop walkthrough</h4>
        <p>Finally, in our last iteration, we planned and ran a desktop walkthrough to simulate how the service would run from the perspective of personas of people with disability. This required us to specify the layout of the library of things, alongside specific cases and how they would be handled, such as when the borrowing journey for those with disability.</p>

        <figure>

            <figcaption>Desktop walkthrough scenario example. Document write-up was made by Nicholas and Jake.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>By doing this, we were able to identify the little details in the service journey that we overlooked. I compiled the feedback in a feedback grid once again, but the following are the main points.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>We forgot to provide a way for the user to locate their locker in the library of things given their locker number in their booking. This was addressed by adding aisle signs. These signs are to be made tactile and <b>Tactile Ground Surface Indicators (TGSIs)</b> were also to be added to make sure they are accessible to the four disability personas.</li>
            <li>Basins were added for staff to wash wearables after they are returned.</li>
            <li>Valuables were placed out of sight to prevent enticing potential stealers.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Outcome</h3>
        <p>The final outcome was presented as a service journey map made by Jesslyn, which you can see in her portfolio. In essence, we have designed a library of things service which allow students to borrow (expensive) equipment for hobbies, allowing them to explore hobbies and thus connecting with like-minded people, potentially improving their wellbeing. This would address the issue of students being unable to explore hobbies due to budget constraints caused by the cost of living crisis.</p>

        <h3>Challenges and growth</h3>
        <p>There were various issues we encountered throughout the process, but one major one related to my contributions of compiling feedback is deciding <em>what</em> to do with the feedback—many of us have different and conflicting ideas, and it was hard to choose which ones to go ahead with. Possible reasons for this include:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Not reading the prompt carefully before developing ideas, making it difficult for us to determine what would best address the prompt and problem.</li>
            <li>Not having a single source of truth for our current ideas and service we are designing, which resulted in e.g. misunderstandings in the locker technology (centralised system like Australia Post without PINs that opens automatically or individual PINs for each locker that a computer resets every day) and whether each item has their own designated locker or whether items are only placed in lockers when booked (thus being stored on shelves in a storage room otherwise). Designs for our services were scattered throughout online documents, Discord, and Miro, to name a few.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Thus to facilitate better teamwork in the future, we should:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Carefully read the prompt and understand the problem—they say that “understanding [the] problem is half the solution”! (e.g. source: <a href="https://www.henricodolfing.com/2018/05/understanding-your-problem-is-half.html">Henrico Dolfing</a>)</li>
            <li>Have a source of truth that is easily accessible to everyone, e.g. documenting the current service idea and design clearly in one document or folder.</li>
        </ol>
